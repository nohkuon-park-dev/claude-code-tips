## What It Does

Firecrawl CLI turns web pages into structured data files you can actually use.

**Key advantages:**
1. Results saved directly to file — easy to pass into next task
2. Can scrape entire documentation/help centers in one command
3. Saved files can be searched, summarized, or converted to PDF

The mental shift: **"reading a web page"** → **"converting it into reusable data"**
